:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|
| Biologists | Intermediate | None | Shell basics|


### Learning Objectives

1.	Understand the necessity for, and use of, the command line interface (bash) and HPC for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data.
2.	Understand best practices for designing a ChIP-seq / CUT&RUN / ATAC-seq experiment.
3.	Perform the steps involved in going from raw FASTQ files to peak calls for an individual sample.
4.	Review qualitative ways to assess peak calls and if they support the hypothesis

### Description

This repository has teaching materials for the Understanding chromatin biology using high throughput sequencing workshop. 

> Pre-requisite: Introduction to Shell

This workshop focuses on teaching computational skills to enable the effective use of an high-performance computing environment to implement a ChIP-seq data analysis workflow. In addition to running the workflow from FASTQ files to peak calls, the workshop covers best practice guidelines for ChIP-seq experimental design and data organization/management and data visualization for quality control.

* Introduction to ChIP-seq, CUT&RUN and ATAC-seq
* Experimental design considerations
* QC using FASTQC
* Alignment theory and considerations for ChIP-seq
* Alignment and filtering of reads
* Peak calling
* Peak visualization (using deepTools)
